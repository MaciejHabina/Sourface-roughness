## General info
The program is designed to calculate selected parameters of surface roughness.
In my master thesis I analyzed selected parameters of surface roughness so
I have got a lot of raw data and final results of surface parameters.  
Thanks to this I can check the correctness of output data from my program.
Input data to the program is a file in .txt or .dat format with values from roughness measuring instrument.
It is my first program, I decided to prepare something more useful than "Hello World!". 

## Technologies
* Python 3.7

## Status
Project is in progress
